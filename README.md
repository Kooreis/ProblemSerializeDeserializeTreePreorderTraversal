# Question: How do you serialize and deserialize a tree using preorder traversal? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code offers a solution to the problem of serializing and deserializing a tree using preorder traversal. The code first defines a `TreeNode` class, which is used to create nodes of the tree, each node having a value, a left child, and a right child. The `Codec` class is then defined for the purpose of serialization and deserialization. The `serialize` method within the `Codec` class uses preorder traversal (root, left, right) to convert the tree into a string, with each node value separated by a comma. If a node is null, it is represented as 'null' in the string. The `deserialize` method splits the serialized string into an array of node values and uses the `buildTree` helper method to construct the tree from this array. The `buildTree` method recursively creates a new node for each value in the array, assigning the left and right children by further recursive calls. This way, the original tree structure is recreated. The code demonstrates the serialization and deserialization process by creating a tree, serializing it, and then deserializing it back into a tree.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version. Both versions use a `TreeNode` class to represent the nodes of the tree and a `Codec` class for serialization and deserialization. The `serialize` method in both versions uses preorder traversal to convert the tree into a string, and the `deserialize` method converts the string back into a tree. Both versions also use a helper method (`buildTree` in JavaScript and `deserializeHelper` in TypeScript) to construct the tree from the array of node values.

The main differences between the two versions are due to TypeScript's static typing:

1. In the TypeScript version, types are specified for the properties of the `TreeNode` class (`val`, `left`, `right`) and for the parameters and return values of the methods in the `Codec` class. This provides type checking, which can help prevent errors.

2. In the TypeScript version, the `deserializeHelper` method is marked as `private`, which means it can only be accessed within the same class. This is a feature of TypeScript's stricter object-oriented programming support.

3. In the TypeScript version, the `TreeNode` constructor provides default values for its parameters (`val`, `left`, `right`). This is a feature of TypeScript's support for optional parameters.

4. The TypeScript version uses 'X' as the marker for null nodes in the serialized string, while the JavaScript version uses 'null'. This is not a language feature difference, but a design choice difference between the two versions.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution follows a similar approach to the JavaScript version. It also defines a `TreeNode` structure for the tree nodes and a `Codec` class for serialization and deserialization. The `serialize` method uses preorder traversal to convert the tree into a string, and the `deserialize` method converts the string back into a tree. The `deserializeHelper` private method is used to construct the tree from the input string stream.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in the languages themselves:

1. Memory Management: In C++, we need to manually allocate memory for new nodes using the `new` keyword. In JavaScript, memory management is handled automatically.

2. String Manipulation: In JavaScript, we use template literals to concatenate strings. In C++, we use the `+` operator to concatenate strings and `std::to_string` to convert integers to strings.

3. Null Values: In JavaScript, we use `null` to represent a non-existent node. In C++, we use `NULL`.

4. Input/Output: In JavaScript, we use `console.log` for output. In C++, we use `std::cout`.

5. Parsing Input: In JavaScript, we use `split` to break the serialized string into an array of values and `parseInt` to convert strings to integers. In C++, we use `std::istringstream` to break the serialized string into a stream of values and `stoi` to convert strings to integers.

6. Method Visibility: In JavaScript, all methods are public by default. In C++, we can specify method visibility using `public` and `private` keywords. In this case, `deserializeHelper` is a private method.
